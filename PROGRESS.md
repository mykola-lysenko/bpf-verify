# BPF Verify Pipeline Progress

**Current status:** 115 compiled, 115 verified, 0 skipped.

## Recent baseline

- Full local pipeline after adding `kernel/bpf/range_tree.c`: 115 compiled, 115 verified, 0 skipped.
- CI guardrails now fail on compile failures, verifier failures, skipped objects, and object-open failures.

## Target plan

1. Return to harder `lib/crypto/` files separately if needed.
2. Pick the next Linux source-tree target after the deferred crypto pass.

## Notes for `cmdline.c`

- `cmdline.c` needs local bounded replacements for `simple_strtoull`, `simple_strtol`, `strlen`, `strncmp`, and `skip_spaces` to avoid pulling in large dependencies such as `lib/vsprintf.c` and `lib/string_helpers.c`.
- The cmdline helpers should be forced inline for BPF verification because `get_option()`/`get_options()` update `char **` cursors, and the verifier rejects pointer writes into caller stack frames across subprogram calls.

## Notes for `lib/crypto/`

- Added active verifier targets for `lib/crypto/sha1.c`, `lib/crypto/gf128hash.c`, and `lib/crypto/gf128mul.c`.
- Deferred `md5.c` and `des.c` because clang times out compiling those full translation units in this harness.
- Deferred `blake2b.c` because the generic compression frame exceeds the BPF stack limit.
- Deferred `sha3.c` because it needs separate include-shim work around `__ffs`/`utils.c`.

## Notes for `kernel/bpf/range_tree.c`

- Added the real `kernel/bpf/range_tree.c` target with `lib/rbtree.c` included under internal linkage to avoid unsupported indirect callback opcodes.
- The harness verifies empty-tree lookup, range size calculation, best-fit `range_tree_find()`, and first-range `range_tree_set()` insertion.
- Full set/find/clear round-trips remain verifier-limited because rb-tree pointers stored in `.bss` allocator nodes are reloaded as scalars.
